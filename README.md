## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

All libraries cited in the code are pre-installed along with the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should be executable using Python versions 3.*.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project took a deeper look at a survey on a small international student body conducted in 2019. I would like to know which demographic tend to do well/poorly and what can be improved in the course design to help them do better or be more interested. Thus, I would like to answer a few questions by analyzing the survey data:

1. Which age group demonstrates the best academic performance?
2. Which program has the students tend to perform well?
3. Which survey question has the highest correlation to grade performance of the students?
4. Does attending the classes help the students getting better grade?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

- International Students Survey.ipynb
- International students Time management data.csv
- Sheet2.csv

The full set of files used in this data analytic study including my python code in jupyter format and the two .csv files including the dataset publicly available in Kaggle.  
The only jupyter notebook available here is to showcase the analytic work answering the questions as raised above regarding the International Student Survey. 
The literal analysis is posted in Medium.  This README also serves as a supplement for the readers who are interested in how I code into the data analysis.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://jimpikkin.medium.com/a-quick-glance-of-student-time-management-vs-performance-8b1815e2d5).
